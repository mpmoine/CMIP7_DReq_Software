In CMIP7, DCPP will build on recent improvements in models, data assimilation, and model initialization to provide an updated reference of decadal climate variability and prediction skill.

In comparison with CMIP6, the highest priority retrospective predictions (or hindcasts) will be a core set (the DCPP-DECK) which focuses on a shorter verification window with fewer start dates, a minimal ensemble size, and multi-year forecast lead times. It is envisioned that such reduced requirements of the DCPP-DECK will encourage more groups to take part in DCPP in CMIP7. The DCPP-DECK will also allow DCPP to diversify into questions it has not currently addressed due to the expense of the experiment, including for example high-resolution initialized predictions and large ensembles of multi-year predictions. Component B organizes the ongoing production and dissemination of real-time multi-model decadal forecasts.

The role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system continues to be of great interest. In particular, recent simulations suggest both the possibility of significant changes in large-scale aspects of circulation and response to climate change, as well as improvements in small-scale processes and extremes.\nThe first HighResMIP (HighResMIP v1.0 for CMIP6) was successful in producing a baseline multi-model assessment of global simulations with model grid spacings  of around 50km in the atmosphere and 0.25\u00b0 in the ocean, comparing to models with standard resolutions typically used as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) DECK experiments. In addition to a large number of peer-reviewed publications using the published HighResMIP datasets, the results were widely cited in the IPCC AR6 WG1 report, and were the basis for a variety of derived datasets including tracked cyclones (both tropical and extratropical), storm surge and others used for impact studies.\nHowever, there were a number of aspects of HighResMIPv1.0 that were less than ideal, through both practical and design choices at that time. These included: long (and relatively expensive) simulation designs, which even so only reached to 2050; specification of little to no tuning between standard and higher resolution model configurations; simplified aerosol specification; small ensemble size; short spin-up for coupled simulations; one future scenario. In addition, with the increasing use of global km-scale models (currently run for relatively short timescales), there is a danger of a gap opening between such models and the CMIP community which still (generally) relies on ~100km model simulations.\nTherefore we propose an updated HighResMIP v2.0 to improve and extend the previous work, to address new science questions as well as some of these shortcomings above, and to further advance our understanding of the role of horizontal resolution on climate simulation. With further increases in high-performance computing (HPC) resources and new models able to take full advantage of such resources, enhanced investigation of the drivers and consequences of variability and change in both large- synoptic-scale weather and climate is made possible.\nThe set of HighResMIP v2.0 experiments is divided into several tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs spanning the period 1950\u20132100, together with some additional shorter experiments to enable process understanding and links to other communities. This paper describes the experimental set-up of HighResMIPv2, the analysis plan, and the connection with other CMIP projects. It also aims to link to other international efforts such as the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) lighthouse activities.\n",

As uncertainties in future sea level arise due to both the climate forcing and the response of the ice sheets, a primary focus for ISMIP6 was to become better integrated in the CMIP6 initiative.

The first relates to dynamic ice sheets within global coupled climate models, while the second is based on outputs from climate models to force standalone ice sheet models (perhaps coupled to regional ocean and/or atmosphere models). We will thus have different protocols for each type of modeling activity, and these will be related by a common set of scenarios.

In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) aims to further advance understanding of the impacts of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) on climate, specifically addressing the following questions. (1) What are the effects of LULCC on climate and biogeochemical cycling (past\u2013future)? (2) What are the impacts of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, and are there regional land-management strategies with the promise to help mitigate climate change? In addressing these questions, LUMIP will also address a range of more detailed science questions to get at process-level attribution, uncertainty, data requirements, and other related issues in more depth and sophistication than possible in a multi-model context to date. There will be particular focus on the separation and quantification of the effects on climate from LULCC relative to all forcings, separation of biogeochemical from biogeophysical effects of land use, the unique impacts of land-cover change vs. land-management change, modulation of land-use impact on climate by land\u2013atmosphere coupling strength, and the extent to which impacts of enhanced CO2 concentrations on plant photosynthesis are modulated by past and future land use.\n\nLUMIP involves three major sets of science activities: (1) development of an updated and expanded historical and future land-use data set, (2) an experimental protocol for specific LUMIP experiments for CMIP6, and (3) definition of metrics and diagnostic protocols that quantify model performance, and related sensitivities, with respect to LULCC. In this paper, we describe LUMIP activity (2), i.e., the LUMIP simulations that will formally be part of CMIP6. These experiments are explicitly designed to be complementary to simulations requested in the CMIP6 DECK and historical simulations and other CMIP6 MIPs including ScenarioMIP, C4MIP, LS3MIP, and DAMIP. LUMIP includes a two-phase experimental design. Phase one features idealized coupled and land-only model simulations designed to advance process-level understanding of LULCC impacts on climate, as well as to quantify model sensitivity to potential land-cover and land-use change. Phase two experiments focus on quantification of the historic impact of land use and the potential for future land management decisions to aid in mitigation of climate change. This paper documents these simulations in detail, explains their rationale, outlines plans for analysis, and describes a new subgrid land-use tile data request for selected variables (reporting model output data separately for primary and secondary land, crops, pasture, and urban land-use types).

Meltwater-induced changes in ocean circulation have the potential to influence the ability of the Southern Ocean to uptake heat and carbon, providing an important feedback on climate change. Nonetheless, almost all existing coupled climate models have fixed ice sheets, and lack the physics required to represent the dominant sources of Antarctic melt. These missing ice dynamics represent a key uncertainty that is unaccounted for in current global climate change projections.\n\nThe goal of the Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica Model Intercomparison Project (SOFIAMIP) is to quantify the climate system response to Antarctic meltwater input. Notably, changes in ocean dynamics, sea ice loss and ice shelf melt around the Antarctic margins, as well as resulting changes in atmospheric dynamics, precipitation, global warming rate and sea level rise are of direct interest and relevance both to CMIP and resulting climate assessments. Associated responses and feedbacks are model dependent and SOFIAMIP will enable the quantification of such model uncertainty.\n\nThe MIP proposes a series of coupled atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice model experiments, including idealized meltwater experiments, historical experiments with observationally consistent meltwater input, and future scenarios driven by meltwater inputs derived from stand-alone ice sheet models.

At present, no MIP exists which focuses specifically on identifying and evaluating the risks of tipping dynamics in the Earth system. Filling this gap, TIPMIP will shed light on critical processes currently underrepresented in other MIPs and in Earth system models.\n\nWhat are tipping elements?\nTipping elements are components of the Earth system highly susceptible to reaching a critical threshold \u2013 a tipping point \u2013 beyond which amplifying feedbacks can result in abrupt and/or irreversible changes in response to anthropogenic climate change. Crossing a tipping point can lead the systems to transition to an alternative state, often with reduced resilience to perturbations and recovery. Once triggered, the tipping of one of these elements can have far-reaching impacts on the global climate, ecosystems and humankind. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of tipping elements and associated risks is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of global environmental change.\n\nWhy is this project important?\nOur current scientific knowledge of tipping dynamics in the Earth system involves a broad range of uncertainties on (i) which components of the climate system and biosphere might show tipping behaviour, (ii) if so, at which forcing levels the critical thresholds are located, (iii) which feedback processes they are associated with, and (iv) if and how potential tipping cascades might evolve.

As climate change accelerates, these extreme conditions are becoming more frequent and severe, posing significant risks to marine ecosystems and coastal communities. This opportunity will collect the high-frequency multidisciplinary approach to analyze these phenomena, their causes, and their effects, ultimately contributing to better management strategies and mitigation efforts. \u00a0Extreme sea levels are primarily caused by storm surges often in combination with astronomical tides, waves and/or river overflow, which requires climate-scale forcing data at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales to be combined with other resources offline. This opportunity is particularly relevant to revealing differences between eddy-permitting and coarse-resolution models.\n\nLong-term assessment of ocean extremes important for identifying vulnerable regions, designing coastal protection to appropriate levels, and assessing infrastructure and ecosystem viability. It also enables various adaptation measures to be considered and tested via sensitivity testing. In the coming decades, ocean extremes and associated floods are likely to remain a leading cause of natural disasters due to the combined effects of the increasing frequency and intensity of extremes combined with increased coastal development associated with greater exposure.\n",

The observational counterparts of these new liquid water path (LWP) and droplet effective radius (r\\_eff) joint histograms of cloud fraction have been used to estimate global aerosol indirect effects from observations in [Wall et al. (2023)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/13125/2023/). Our new method utilizes monthly output of these new MODIS joint histograms and a decomposition technique from [Zelinka et al. (2013)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/14/jcli-d-12-00555.1.xml) to separately quantify the Twomey effect, liquid-water path (LWP) adjustment, and cloud-fraction (CF) adjustment for liquid-topped clouds in climate models. The paper highlighting the first use case of this method in GCMs is in preparation and should be submitted soon and will provide a framework for performing this decomposition. Due to its reliance on only monthly output from a pair of deck and fast track simulations (piClim-control and piClim-aer), and its ability to separately decompose SW ERFaci into its three separate components, we believe that inclusion of these new diagnostics in the CMIP7 plan would strongly support our understanding of SW ERFaci in GCMs. These new MODIS diagnostics can also be used in other studies of cloud feedbacks, such as Wall et al. (in prep), who have implemented the new histograms in five CMIP6-era GCMs to quantify the strength of cloud scattering and emissivity feedbacks from cloud-phase conversions.\n",

Comparing models between each other or with observations becomes useless, because based on the method sfcWind is obtained, there can be up to 25% difference. \n\nAdditionally, it is unclear how sfcWindmax is obtained, is it instantaneous? Is it for the model time step? Since CMIP6 docs are down, I had to track the modelling centers to ask this questions and everyone has a different opinions even within one center.

A recent study based on OMIP (Treguier et al. 2023, <https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3849-2023> )discusses the fact that using the first model level as a reference makes mlotst less comparable with obs (obs-based datasets reference the MLD to 10m because the diurnal cycle is not well-sampled by observations). Furthermore, the difference of the depth of the first model level between different models makes a significant difference in the computed MLDs in some seasons/regions (Treguier et al., 2023).\n",
